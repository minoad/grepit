[*]The Valley's morale is once again crushed. Another indictment on their own territory, with their strongest magi and a ralley of guards turning out proving nothing before a small force sends many into a cascade of fear and reclusion. Valley people are torn between revenge and isolationism, almost violently- With Alpheral, then Tywod Du downed almost effortlessly, without enemy casualties, few feel the furor beyond the most hotblooded to march against such an inhuman enemy. Many wish to simply burn the bridge, harkening back to simpler days before they meddled in politics, citing it as the downfall of the valley viciously. Their most powerful magi holding nothing to protect them does little to comfort this; several blame the sacred knights, and even Alpheral's own soft hand in handling Oscuri in the first place for this.
